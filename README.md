## Magic Counter

This serves as a very basic health tracker for Magic The Gathering.

To use this, please download Elm - Electron by:

``npm i -g elm electron-prebuilt
``

Run from CLI:

``
electron main.js
``

#### Next Feature:
  A creature list to keep track of counters and tokens.


#### Note:

  This project stemmed from a need around Turing.io to keep track of health outside of pen and paper.
  Learning Elm has been a little side project for me, and I thought this would be a nice and fruitful starter
  project.

  Props to:
  [Zach Koch](https://medium.com/@ezekeal/building-an-electron-app-with-elm-part-1-boilerplate-3416a730731f#.or6eich48)
  for the Electron Integration.

  I will be working on adding features into this to continue ramping my learning of Elm.
